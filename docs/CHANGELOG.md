## Unreleased: V1 finish-line run (2026-11-10, branch `goal/finish`, local only)

**Added**
- The owner is emailed the moment a visitor sends an enquiry (`server/_notify.php`, `$OWNER_ALERTS`). Best effort, after
  the response, capped at 20 an hour, audited (D-061, K-146).
- A client's data deletion request opens at high priority and emails the owner with the reply-by date one month on (K-095).
- Every `cron.php` run leaves a per-job heartbeat, and Today shows the owner roles which scheduled jobs have not run in
  36 hours (K-145).
- `npm run test:browser`: a real headless Chromium drives the built site against local PHP and a throwaway database
  (the contact form at 375 and 1280 px). New dev dependency `playwright-core` 1.64.1.
- `npm run check:facts`: lists every placeholder still on the built public pages and the owner fact each one waits for.
- `npm run drill:restore`: restores a database dump into a throwaway database and checks tables, row counts and orphans.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` (the frozen V1 finish line), this changelog, `docs/VERIFICATION.md`.

**Changed**
- `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` compacted from 2,397 to about 1,460 lines by merging closed issues into one table; the earlier
  text stays in git (`git show d30e95b:docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md`).
- `gk_send_email` accepts an optional `timeout` (alerts use 8 seconds; everything else keeps 20).

**Needs the owner before it does anything live:** `$OWNER_ALERTS` and working `$SMTP_*` in `config.php`
([DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) section 5). No SQL, no `.htaccess`.

**Not changed:** public copy, prices, legal pages, sign-in, payments, schema.
